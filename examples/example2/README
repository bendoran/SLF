== EXAMPLE 2 ==

= MVC, Database & POST Example =

Controller -> root.php has 2 functions, index and addstudent : 

	index :		 Uses the student model to get the students, these 
				 students are stored in an array and passed to the loaded
				 view.
			
	addstudent : Adds a student that is sent to the controller by 
				 the get_post() function get_post returns an object of 
				 all $_POST paramaters sent to the controller. It uses the
				 post variables to call add_student on the model. It then 
				 renders the view, which (with the value submitted) either
				 renders a form, or a link to return to the list page.
				 
Model -> student_model.php has 2 functions add_student & get_student.

	get_student: Calls a simple SELECT Query on the internal $db object that is present
				 in all models. This makes a subsequent query (using PDO) to get an
				 array of Student objects.
				 
	add_student: Again, calls a simple query (this time INSERT) on the $db object, passing 
				 through a set of bound parameters as an array.
				 
View -> home_view.php renders a list of students, expects an array of Student Objects to load.
View -> form_view.php renders a form for adding a student, expects a single "$submitted" boolean 
		value to determine whether a form or navigation should be rendered.



= SQL to Create Student Table = 

CREATE TABLE `students` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `first_name` tinytext,
  `last_name` tinytext,
  `gender` char(1) DEFAULT NULL,
  `dob` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `date_enrolled` date DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=11 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
