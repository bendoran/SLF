== EXAMPLE 1 ==

Example shows how catnap controllers work, 
each controller is represented by URI these are 
mapped to controller functions. 

URLS are inspected and a controller is loaded, if a controller 
cannot be found in the root path a 404 page is shown.

URIS are mapped by firstly folder, then class, then function, the
"root.php" file represents the folder as a whole, and can be used 
to catch the default URI for that folder.

E.g: 

http://website.com/ would execute the index.php of the root.php controller.
http://website.com/login could be either root.php's index function, login.php's 
index function or the root.php's (in a folder called login) index function, or finally
if non of the above our found, the index function will be called with the string "login".

The URI presendence is folders, then classes, then functions, then parameters..

Folders : 

http://<url>/examples/example1/foo => /app/controller/foo/root.php->index()
